        <h2>Question-1: What is DOM ? and what is purpose of DOM ?</h1>
            <p>Ans: The full name of DOM is Document Object Model.The Document Object Model is a programming API for
                documents.It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and
                manipulated.DOM is an array like object. If needed we can use it as array ,it's not an array. document
                is a name for a web page, and they consider the DOM as a model for all the stuff on the web page.The DOM
                is represented as a type of data structure called a tree. Every object in the DOM is hierarchically
                under another object, and any object can have multiple children but only one parent.

        <h2>Question-3: What is event bubble? Describe.</h1>
            <p>Ans:The Event bubbling in JavaScript is a type of event propagation.It happens when an element receives
                an event, and that event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to
                the root element.

        <h2>Question-4: What is callback Function ? what is the use of it?</h1>
            <p>Ans:A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.This technique allows a function
                to call another function.It can run after another function has finished.We need callback functions
                because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program from
                running until they're completed.
